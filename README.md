## Models

If you intend to create a QA system, you can use our QA-specialized models for your purpose: 

 - [T5 (small)](tbd)
 - [T5 (base)](tbd)
 - [T5 (large)](tbd)
 - [T5 (3B)](tbd)
 - [T5 (11B)](tbd)

You can use these in two ways: 
- If you don't have any training data, you can use them for [the evaluation](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer#eval). 
- If you training data, you can use them as your initial models and [fine-tune on them](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer#fine-tuning).

For more details see [the T5 reposityry](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer). 
 
BART will come soon!
